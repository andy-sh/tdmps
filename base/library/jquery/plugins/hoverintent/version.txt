hoverIntent r5 // 2007.03.27
is a plug-in that attempts to determine the user's intent... 
like a crystal ball, only with mouse movement! It works like (and was derived from) jQuery's built-in hover. 
However, instead of immediately calling the onMouseOver function, 
it waits until the user's mouse slows down enough before making the call.
